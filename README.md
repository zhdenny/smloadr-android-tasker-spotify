# smloadr-android-tasker-spotify

**REQUIREMENTS: Tasker, AutoTools, AutoInput, AutoNotification, and AutoWeb, AutoApps. You also need to have an SSH-accessible computer with smloadr functioning.**

**In AutoTools, go to Webscreens and import the "Bubble" webscreen and the "Notification" webscreen** 

Android Tasker project to monitor what you listen to on Spotify and shows a button. Press the button and you'll get a popup verifying the song/album you are currently listening to. After tapping to confirm selection, it will (in the background) SSH into remote server and send smloadr commands related to the selection. See screenshots showing the green-outlined download button and the following verification popup. I have the button strategically placed depending on what app I'm in....I set it up to only show when I'm on the Now Playing Spotify screen or am Actively Navigation somewhere on the Google Maps navigation screen.
