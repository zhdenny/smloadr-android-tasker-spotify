# smloadr-android-tasker-spotify

Android Tasker project to monitor what you listen to on Spotify and shows a button. Press the button and you'll get a popup verifying the song/album you are currently listening to. After tapping to confirm selection, it will (in the background) SSH into remote server and send smloadr commands related to the selection. See screenshots showing the green-outlined download button and the following verification popup. I have the button strategically placed depending on what app I'm in....I set it up to only show when I'm on the Now Playing Spotify screen or am Actively Navigation somewhere on the Google Maps navigation screen.

**REQUIREMENTS: Tasker, AutoTools, AutoInput, AutoNotification, and AutoWeb, AutoApps. You also need to have an SSH-accessible computer with smloadr functioning.**

**In AutoTools, go to Webscreens and import the "Bubble" webscreen and the "Notification" webscreen. In AutoWeb, go Import the Deezer API.** 

I know it is a lot of stuff required to get this working......but if you are any real Tasker user, you likely already have many of these tools under your belt already. And if you aren't a Tasker user yet, become one. The app is like Beethoven's 5th Symphony for Android.
